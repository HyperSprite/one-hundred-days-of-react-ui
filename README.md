#My 100 Days of React UI Repo

>Move along, nothing to see here (yet)

I am following along with [this](https://www.fullstackreact.com/react-daily-ui/001-sign-up-form/) but wanted to build components in separate files and I wanted it to be ES6. So I've been reworking things from there. The nice thing here is if I build one button and use it everywhere, if I want to change that button, I only have to do it in one place.

Started this using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
